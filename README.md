Here are two fo the main the design choices I made in creating the calculator: 
- I made it so that when the number is greater than 100000000000000000 or less than -100000000000000000, the number rolls back to zero
- I made it so that you could continuously chain commands together
- Rather than buttons in the calculator, I decided to just use a grid, and
then make the grid sections clickable. I threw in some style to make it have a hover style and a mouse click style so that it looked like it was a button. I thought it looked better.
