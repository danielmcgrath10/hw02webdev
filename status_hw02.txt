Very comfortable

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)

No they don't, they keep getting stuck on the utf-8 encoding meta line even though my index files for this assignment do have them in their "head" section.

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

The part that I had the most trouble with was trying to do path routing on the nginx config file instead of the subdomain routing. 
I ended up not being able to accomplish my goal which was a little disheartening, but the websites work with the subdomain routing.
